1049,Earning on indices and ETFs in the crypto world,"“Which DeFi project should you choose? Which coin to enter now? More than once this question has been circulating in your head. The answer to it is ""none."" However, this does not mean that you should stay out of the market. Contents In order not to waste your time, let's determine if this article is addressed to you? If you are a person already on the cryptocurrency market or just taking their first steps on it, then maybe yes. Perhaps yes, you will change for sure if you are not passionate about the crypto market and do not treat it as your main occupation. If you don't spend a few hours every day researching projects and the market, but want to profit from the upward cryptocurrency trends, this article is written just for you. If, on the other hand, you are a cryptocurrency bank, then ... maybe for you too. Because the crypto landscape is now so extensive that no one is able to comprehend it completely on their own. Because today we will tell you about how to earn (which also involves the risk of loss) on crypto trends, without the need to tediously select projects in which we want to invest. We have two very interesting instruments in traditional financial markets. Indices and ETFs. Their common feature is their basket structure. Let's start with the indexes. Probably everyone who has anything to do with financial markets has heard about such stock exchange indices as Dow Jones, SP500, DAX or our Polish WIG20. Such an index is a basket with selected values ​​to which their weight is assigned. The weight determines how much influence the value of the index has on the price of a given stock. For example, the WIG20 index is an index of the twenty largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Each of these twenty companies has a specific weight with which it affects the value of the index. Indices seem to be a great investment vehicle for people with the approach: I do not know, but they will earn (on a growing market or a trend). I don't have to choose individual stocks, I take the entire index. Which reflects the entire market (WIG), its specific segment (WIG20) or the industry (WIG.Games). There is only one problem - indices are not a financial instrument. They are a statistical tool that illustrates price changes in individual markets, segments and industries. We can track and observe the value of an index, but we cannot buy an index unit. And here, on traditional markets, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) come to our aid. Among them, I will say, we have the so-called index funds. They are a passive investment tool whose portfolio qualitatively and quantitatively reflects a given index. These are instruments that have been enjoying increasing popularity for years. Especially in foreign markets. And no wonder: it is simple and cheap to use, at the same time allowing you to catch the upward trend of a given market or trend. Until now, there has been little talk about indices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The community did not particularly feel the need to create them. Perhaps because, unlike traditional exchanges, where most companies are listed on one market, the most popular coins in crypto are listed on dozens or even hundreds of exchanges. And since most of the most highly valued coins on individual stock exchanges are the same, their indices would be characterized by a very high correlation. Hence the boom of such websites as coinmarketcap or coingecko, which aggregate statistical data on the entire cryptocurrency market. The situation started to change a bit this year, thanks to DeFi. First, we started to have a certain trend in the market that was not correlated with the entire market. Secondly, it is DeFi that is a place where new financial products can be created. So at the moment, these are the most common indices available on decentralized platforms, the vast majority of which try to reflect the trend of decentralized finance. Since these indices have a tokenized form (you can buy a token, i.e. a unit of the index), we can say that they are also ETFs. Two in one. Feel free to review decentralized crypto indices! The indexes I present are based on decentralized solutions. However, recently there are also indices created by centralized exchanges, the tokens of which we can buy on them. There was no place for them in this article, but we will mention them during. In all the cases discussed, these indices allow us to participate in the DeFi trend. We will probably have to wait for other solutions. I myself would like to see indexes with names like ORACLES, ETHKILLERS or POLKADOT. Most likely the first decentralized index on the market, allowing us to be exposed to the DeFi trend. Its first version appeared over a year ago, at the end of November 2019. In the middle of the hot DeFi summer, the composition of the index has changed. There are new coins and the possibility of dynamic management of the composition and weights of the index. At the time of writing this article, the composition of the sDeFi index was as follows: Capitalization: USD 3.9 million This index is an element. This means that it is not backed by actual project tokens in the index. And its value is based on the price information collected from the outside (using the CHAINLINK oracle). The advantage of this solution is the lack of price deviations of the index token even with its relatively low liquidity. This is due to the mechanism of operation of the Synthetix Network, in which each of the tokens uses the full liquidity of the protocol, and the price always comes from the oracle and the transactions that are not concluded do not change it. Learn more about the mechanics behind sDEFI and other synthetic Synthetix tokens in. The token can be purchased at. An interesting fact is that sDEFI also has its inverted twin brother iDEFI. It is a token whose price changes inversely to the price of the coins included in the index. It is therefore the perfect tool to short on the trend of decentralized finance. The PieDAO project offers several different products that we can call cryptocurrency indices or ETFs. Let's take a look at a few of them, bearing in mind that the community is constantly presenting proposals for new indexes that may appear on PieDAO in some time. PieDAO underneath uses a Balancer. So the indexes from this project contain the actual tokens of the projects included in the index underneath. Moreover, they represent a liquidity pool for decentralized applications, therefore they generate additional revenue from fees from token traders based on these pools. DeFi Large Capitalization Index. It contains proven projects, so it is a good solution for conservative investors who do not want to risk looking for new trend stars. They are interested in a more certain and stable profit from the further growth of the trend, which is why they bet on its current leaders. Index Composition: Capitalization: $ 2 Million. DeFi Small Capitalization Project Index. You could say that this is an index of potential DeFi emerging stars. On those who manage to shine, it will be possible to earn more than the market rate of return. However, we have the risk that not all projects will be able to do this. Index composition: Capitalization: $ 1.1 million Index focusing on the entire DeFi trend. It is an example of one of the great things about DeFi - compositional. This feature allows one existing product to be used as a component of another. The DEFI ++ index includes the two previously discussed indices with the following composition: Capitalization: USD 0.6 million. . And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Here we are exposed to the three fundamentally strongest trends in the crypto industry: Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. Capitalization: $ 1.4 million. And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Index designed by the creators of the DeFiPulse website. It can be said that this site is the CoinMarketCap counterpart for DeFi protocols. The index is based on the Tokensets technology and is available through this project. Index weights are systematically updated based on the capitalization of individual assets. Composition of the index: Capitalization: $ 23 million The index has a built-in fee for its developers of 0.95 percent of the index capitalization during the year. Finally, a very interesting ecosystem supported by a bigger idea. Not only creating token indices to have exposure to a given market. But also in order to use the management power of tokens in the index. Recall that most DeFi tokens are tokens that can be voted on in the protocols. Defining the directions of development or parameters of a given project. Few, however, use their tokens for these purposes. This is due, firstly, to a lack of awareness and, secondly, to the transaction fees associated with it. Collecting more of these tokens together in an index can be a factor in activating the management power of the tokens. Now let's move on to the two currently available indexes (more are on their way). An index that tries to reflect the strongest projects from the DeFi trend. Here is its composition Capitalization: $ 11.5 million Index for tokens related to. So, apart from YFI, we have on the list other projects co-created by Andre Cronje and projects with which Yearn Finance cooperates. Index Composition: Market Capitalization: $ 7.3M What would DeFi be without farming? Also, most of the solutions we have discussed allow you to derive additional profit from the index in the form of a protocol managing token, which is responsible for the creation of the index. Typically, this will be a reward for providing liquidity for the index in question. Annual rates of return on this account range from several dozen to several hundred percent per year (but remember which may eat some of the profits or even make us lose out on it). More time is dedicated to this aspect during our next one",https://www.zrozumiecbitcoina.pl/2020/12/18/zarabianie-na-indeksach-i-etfach-w-swiecie-krypto/
1108,"Hackers pulled off a $620 million crypto heist by tricking an engineer into applying for a fake job and opening an offer letter containing spyware, report says","Scammers used an elaborate fake job scheme to steal over $600 million in crypto from the online NFT-based game Axie Infinity, The Block reported Wednesday. The hackers, who the US Treasury linked to North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group , posed as job recruiters on Linkedin and tricked a senior engineer at the game's developer, Sky Mavis, into going through ""multiple rounds of interviews"" for a position that did not exist, sources told the outlet. They then sent the engineer a fabricated offer letter with ""an extremely generous compensation package"" that was laced with spyware , The Block reported. Once downloaded, the hackers could access Axie Infinity's blockchain network known as ""Ronin,"" where users transferred Ethereum-based digital currencies in and out of the game. The security breach, which the company first disclosed back in March, is believed to be one of the largest crypto heists in the world. However, experts told Insider in April that the cyberattack shouldn't be a deterrent to widespread crypto adoption , as the heist was largely due to human error and a lack of cybersecurity rather than a flaw in blockchain technology itself. In May, the US Treasury sanctioned the virtual currency mixer Blender.io, which the department alleged was used to obscure the source of over $20.5 million of the cryptocurrency stolen from Axie Infinity. ""Virtual currency mixers that assist illicit transactions pose a threat to US national security interests,"" Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said in a statement . ""We are taking action against illicit financial activity by the DPRK and will not allow state-sponsored thievery and its money-laundering enablers to go unanswered.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/axie-infinity-crypto-hack-fake-job-offer-letter-spyware-phishing-2022-7
1026,Market Pulse: ETH 2.0 Stakers Are Underwater,"The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is one of the most anticipated, and most watched events in digital asset industry. However, with staked ETH locked up, and market prices declining over 75%, the vast majority of stakers are now firmly underwater on their position. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is one of the most anticipated, and most watched events in the digital asset industry. The transition from the current Ethereum consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake is a major technical and engineering feat. With the Beacon Chain operational since December 2022, many Ethereum investors have deposited their coins to operate a validator. Each validator requires a stake of 32 ETH and can be operated by either solo staking, via a staking pool (e.g. Lido, Rocket Pool), or via exchanges. To become a validator, investors must deposit their 32 ETH into the 2.0 contract, however, as yet there is no date at which these coins can be withdrawn. Nevertheless, the deposit contract has seen a consistent inflow of coins since going live in November 2020. The total ETH deposited has now reached 12.98M ETH, which is over 10.9% of the circulating supply. A total of 8.02M ETH (62%) was deposited before the Nov 2021 market ATH, and the remaining 38% was deposited after. At the November peak, the total USD value of staked ETH reached $39.7 Billion, representing 263,918 network validators. However after the ATH, the USD value in the 2.0 contract dropped by -$25.65 Billion. This is despite an additional inflow of nearly 5M ETH and puts the USD value of staked ETH 65.2% lower than at the ATH. With ETH prices plunging to levels below 2018 ATH, the has been a notable slow-down in 2.0 deposits. Throughout 2020 and 2021, it was common to see between 500 to 1,000 new deposits of 32 ETH per day. Currently, the weekly average number of deposits has dropped to just 122 per day, which is the lowest it has been to date. Aside from fear and uncertainty across the market, another reason may be the somewhat poor rate of profitability that has been experienced by ETH stakers to date. Since ETH cannot be withdrawn yet, we can calculate the value of ETH at the time it was deposited (called the Realized Price). We can see that ETH deposits were sent into the contract at an average price of $2390. With spot prices currently at $1,060, this means ETH 2.0 stakers are on average holding a loss of -55%. If we compare this to the Realized Price for the entire ETH supply, 2.0 stakers are currently shouldering 36.5% larger losses compared to the general Ethereum market. Lastly, we can see that almost all of the 2.0 deposits which are in profit today, were made as far back as Jan 2021, at a time when ETH was under $1,000. As of today, just 17% of the ETH deposited are in profit, with these deposits shown in blue below. With ETH 2.0 staking yield currently at around 4.2%, a decline in overall ETH token price of 55% below the cost basis of the average staker, this perhaps explains, in part, the overall slow-down in deposit activity. A key takeaway from this study, is the observation that investors who utilised liquid staking derivatives like Lido, or trade-able ETH 2.0 tokens on exchanges were likely better able to hedge downside price risk. This and highlights why the demand for these liquid staking derivatives has been so high, alongside the ability to use as collateral in DeFi applications.",https://insights.glassnode.com/market-pulse-eth-stakers-underwater/
1077,First Mover Americas: ETH Climbs 4% as Traders Are Optimistic About Upcoming Merge,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. Crypto markets were mostly in the green, with ether ( ETH ) taking the lead, up 4%, while stock futures edged higher ahead of the U.S. jobs data release scheduled for Friday. Investors in the U.S. awaited the jobs report from the Labor Department, which is released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 3% over the last 24 hours, whereas ether was up by 4.3%, making it one of the top performing altcoins on the day. Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex, said that ETH’s uptick could be related to the optimism surrounding the upcoming Ethereum blockchain Merge. “This has encouraged a lot of retail investors to preempt an investment strategy for ETH,” said Kssis. “But it may be short lived as there are still strong sell orders in the market supported by ETH liquidations,” Kssis said. In traditional markets, the British pound was up slightly on Thursday after the news surfaced U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would resign . The departure is likely to delay the country's plans to create a friendly environment for the crypto industry. Against the U.S. dollar, the pound lifted to $1.20 from $1.19, where it was Wednesday. Meanwhile, after the news that Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, shares of the broker have been suspended from trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange as it looks at whether the shares meet its listing requirements. Genesis Global Trading, a CoinDesk sister company, has confirmed exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Genesis’s CEO Michael Moro confirmed Three Arrows Capital was the large counterparty that failed to meet a large margin call in June, forcing liquidation of the related collateral. Adding to the list of departures moving from traditional finance over to crypto is another JPMorgan (JPM) executive, Eric Wragge, a former managing director at the bank. He joined the Algorand blockchain as head of business development and capital markets. And finally, the developers behind meme coin, SHIB , has teased plans to expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem with a decentralized stablecoin. More on that here . By Danny Nelson and Nikhilesh De A class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court last week accuses key players in the Solana ecosystem of illegally profiting from SOL, the blockchain’s native token that according to the suit is an unregistered security. “The cornerstone of the value of SOL securities is the sum of Solana Labs, Solana Foundation and [Anatoly] Yakovenko’s management and implementation of the Solana blockchain,” the suit alleged. It described SOL as a highly centralized cryptocurrency that has benefited its insiders to the detriment of retail traders. Filed by California resident Mark Young, who said he bought SOL in late summer 2021, the suit names Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko, crypto VC giant Multicoin Capital, Multicoin’s Kyle Samani and trading desk FalconX. A Solana spokesperson declined to comment. Multicoin and FalconX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Young alleges that the way SOL was created and sold meets the three tenets of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court precedent commonly used as a barometer for whether the sale of something is a security or not. “Purchasers who bought SOL securities have invested money or given valuable services to a common enterprise, Solana. These purchasers have a reasonable expectation of profit based upon the efforts of the promoters, Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, to build a blockchain network that will rival Bitcoin and Ethereum and become the accepted framework for transactions on the blockchain,” the filing said, addressing the three forks of the Howey Test. In the filing, Young pointed to several sales of the SOL token or agreements to sell the SOL token ahead of the public sale of the token. Solana Labs filed a Form D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (a filing saying the sale was of securities exempt from SEC registration), noting the company was selling “the future rights” to around 80 million SOL, according to the filing. Multicoin, a major crypto venture capital firm that has invested heavily across the Solana ecosystem, “offloaded millions of dollars of SOL” onto retail after “relentlessly” promoting the token in spite of Solana blockchain’s tech issues, the suit alleged. This alleged offload passed through FalconX over-the-counter trading desks, the suit said. Young’s law firm, Roche Freedman, also recently filed suit against Binance.US for allegedly misleading investors during the Terra implosion. A lawyer for Roche Freedman did not pick up the phone.

1069,Decentralized Mixer Tornado Cash Makes Its User Interface Open-Source,"Today, the Tornado Cash community announced a fully open-sourced user interface (UI) for Tornado Cash Classic . This means any public contributor interested in improving the design can simply review the code and make pull requests through its GitHub . The move is in line with the community’s efforts to prioritize decentralization, transparency and security. Tornado Cash is a decentralized mixer protocol that enables private transactions on Ethereum. Mixers are smart contracts that accept, pool and mix cryptocurrency from multiple senders in order to increase privacy by obscuring potential audit trails. Users send ether to the Tornado Cash smart contract and withdraw that ether and send it to a new public address that has no link to the sending address. Read more: Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used? The Tornado Cash community is intimately familiar with UI vulnerabilities. In February 2020, a developer discovered a bug that revealed private user details when someone clicked a “share” button from the interface. The bug was quickly resolved and no funds were lost. This is a prime example of how open-source projects benefit from having many eyeballs on a product, which makes it easier to spot and fix vulnerabilities. The irrevocable nature of smart contracts means wallets and mixers like Tornado Cash must make it safe and simple for unsophisticated users to send and receive funds. In its announcement , Tornado Cash emphasized, “We personally grew fond of the black and green floating astronaut associated with the protocol. However, you should know our credo by now: We will always lean towards more decentralization.”",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/07/decentralized-mixer-tornado-cash-open-sources-its-user-interface/
