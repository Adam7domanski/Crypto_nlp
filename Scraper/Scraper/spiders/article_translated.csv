Earning on indices and ETFs in the crypto world,"“Which DeFi project should you choose? Which coin to enter now? More than once this question has been circulating in your head. The answer to it is ""none."" However, this does not mean that you should stay out of the market. Contents In order not to waste your time, let's determine if this article is addressed to you? If you are a person already on the cryptocurrency market or just taking their first steps on it, then maybe yes. Perhaps yes, you will change for sure if you are not passionate about the crypto market and do not treat it as your main occupation. If you don't spend a few hours every day researching projects and the market, but want to profit from the upward cryptocurrency trends, this article is written just for you. If, on the other hand, you are a cryptocurrency bank, then ... maybe for you too. Because the crypto landscape is now so extensive that no one is able to comprehend it completely on their own. Because today we will tell you about how to earn (which also involves the risk of loss) on crypto trends, without the need to tediously select projects in which we want to invest. We have two very interesting instruments in traditional financial markets. Indices and ETFs. Their common feature is their basket structure. Let's start with the indexes. Probably everyone who has anything to do with financial markets has heard about such stock exchange indices as Dow Jones, SP500, DAX or our Polish WIG20. Such an index is a basket with selected values ​​to which their weight is assigned. The weight determines how much influence the value of the index has on the price of a given stock. For example, the WIG20 index is an index of the twenty largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Each of these twenty companies has a specific weight with which it affects the value of the index. Indices seem to be a great investment vehicle for people with the approach: I do not know, but they will earn (on a growing market or a trend). I don't have to choose individual stocks, I take the entire index. Which reflects the entire market (WIG), its specific segment (WIG20) or the industry (WIG.Games). There is only one problem - indices are not a financial instrument. They are a statistical tool that illustrates price changes in individual markets, segments and industries. We can track and observe the value of an index, but we cannot buy an index unit. And here, on traditional markets, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) come to our aid. Among them, I will say, we have the so-called index funds. They are a passive investment tool whose portfolio qualitatively and quantitatively reflects a given index. These are instruments that have been enjoying increasing popularity for years. Especially in foreign markets. And no wonder: it is simple and cheap to use, at the same time allowing you to catch the upward trend of a given market or trend. Until now, there has been little talk about indices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The community did not particularly feel the need to create them. Perhaps because, unlike traditional exchanges, where most companies are listed on one market, the most popular coins in crypto are listed on dozens or even hundreds of exchanges. And since most of the most highly valued coins on individual stock exchanges are the same, their indices would be characterized by a very high correlation. Hence the boom of such websites as coinmarketcap or coingecko, which aggregate statistical data on the entire cryptocurrency market. The situation started to change a bit this year, thanks to DeFi. First, we started to have a certain trend in the market that was not correlated with the entire market. Secondly, it is DeFi that is a place where new financial products can be created. So at the moment, these are the most common indices available on decentralized platforms, the vast majority of which try to reflect the trend of decentralized finance. Since these indices have a tokenized form (you can buy a token, i.e. a unit of the index), we can say that they are also ETFs. Two in one. Feel free to review decentralized crypto indices! The indexes I present are based on decentralized solutions. However, recently there are also indices created by centralized exchanges, the tokens of which we can buy on them. There was no place for them in this article, but we will mention them during. In all the cases discussed, these indices allow us to participate in the DeFi trend. We will probably have to wait for other solutions. I myself would like to see indexes with names like ORACLES, ETHKILLERS or POLKADOT. Most likely the first decentralized index on the market, allowing us to be exposed to the DeFi trend. Its first version appeared over a year ago, at the end of November 2019. In the middle of the hot DeFi summer, the composition of the index has changed. There are new coins and the possibility of dynamic management of the composition and weights of the index. At the time of writing this article, the composition of the sDeFi index was as follows: Capitalization: USD 3.9 million This index is an element. This means that it is not backed by actual project tokens in the index. And its value is based on the price information collected from the outside (using the CHAINLINK oracle). The advantage of this solution is the lack of price deviations of the index token even with its relatively low liquidity. This is due to the mechanism of operation of the Synthetix Network, in which each of the tokens uses the full liquidity of the protocol, and the price always comes from the oracle and the transactions that are not concluded do not change it. Learn more about the mechanics behind sDEFI and other synthetic Synthetix tokens in. The token can be purchased at. An interesting fact is that sDEFI also has its inverted twin brother iDEFI. It is a token whose price changes inversely to the price of the coins included in the index. It is therefore the perfect tool to short on the trend of decentralized finance. The PieDAO project offers several different products that we can call cryptocurrency indices or ETFs. Let's take a look at a few of them, bearing in mind that the community is constantly presenting proposals for new indexes that may appear on PieDAO in some time. PieDAO underneath uses a Balancer. So the indexes from this project contain the actual tokens of the projects included in the index underneath. Moreover, they represent a liquidity pool for decentralized applications, therefore they generate additional revenue from fees from token traders based on these pools. DeFi Large Capitalization Index. It contains proven projects, so it is a good solution for conservative investors who do not want to risk looking for new trend stars. They are interested in a more certain and stable profit from the further growth of the trend, which is why they bet on its current leaders. Index Composition: Capitalization: $ 2 Million. DeFi Small Capitalization Project Index. You could say that this is an index of potential DeFi emerging stars. On those who manage to shine, it will be possible to earn more than the market rate of return. However, we have the risk that not all projects will be able to do this. Index composition: Capitalization: $ 1.1 million Index focusing on the entire DeFi trend. It is an example of one of the great things about DeFi - compositional. This feature allows one existing product to be used as a component of another. The DEFI ++ index includes the two previously discussed indices with the following composition: Capitalization: USD 0.6 million. . And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Here we are exposed to the three fundamentally strongest trends in the crypto industry: Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. Capitalization: $ 1.4 million. And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Index designed by the creators of the DeFiPulse website. It can be said that this site is the CoinMarketCap counterpart for DeFi protocols. The index is based on the Tokensets technology and is available through this project. Index weights are systematically updated based on the capitalization of individual assets. Composition of the index: Capitalization: $ 23 million The index has a built-in fee of 0.95 percent of the index capitalization during the year. Finally, a very interesting ecosystem supported by a bigger idea. Not only creating token indices to have exposure to a given market. But also in order to use the management power of tokens in the index. Recall that most DeFi tokens are tokens that can be voted on in the protocols. Defining the directions of development or parameters of a given project. Few, however, use their tokens for these purposes. This is due, firstly, to a lack of awareness and, secondly, to the transaction fees associated with it. Collecting more of these tokens together in an index can be a factor in activating the management power of the tokens. Now let's move on to the two currently available indexes (more are on their way). An index that tries to reflect the strongest projects in the DeFi trend. Here is its composition Capitalization: $ 11.5 million Index for tokens related to. So, apart from YFI, we have on the list other projects co-created by Andre Cronje and projects with which Yearn Finance cooperates. Index Composition: Market Capitalization: $ 7.3M What would DeFi be without farming? Also, most of the solutions we have discussed allow you to derive additional profit from the index in the form of a protocol managing token, which is responsible for the creation of the index. Typically, this will be a reward for providing liquidity for the index in question. Annual rates of return on this account range from several dozen to several hundred percent per year (but remember which may eat some of the profits or even make us lose out on it). More time is dedicated to this aspect during our next one",0
in,"Achieva Credit Union has become the first of its kind in Florida to allow customers to purchase bitcoin. The functionality was released in a new application on Tuesday. Customer curiosity for bitcoin rose once the credit union allowed third-party services to enable bitcoin purchases. Florida-based Achieva Credit Union became the first credit union to offer customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin through a new app, according to a report from the Tampa Bay Times . The app reportedly went live this past Tuesday through a partnership with bitcoin bank NYDIG , which specializes in connecting traditional financial infrastructure to the bitcoin ecosystem. Previously, Achieva customers were only capable of making bitcoin trades through third-party applications. Tracy Ingram, chief digital and infrastructure officer at Achieva, explained that integrating the service into the credit union’s proprietary app would give a greater level of access to its customers. In fact, in the past year Achieva watched as $2.6 million of third-party bitcoin transactions took place, according to Ingram. Customer curiosity since the enabling of these extended services has widely grown for the credit union. “They’ll come in, they’ll call and ask, ‘What are we doing? What should we look at?’” Ingram explained. “There’s a lot of consumers out there who are crypto-curious, and that’s no different for our members. They’re really looking for information and education about, ‘What is cryptocurrency? How does it all work?’” Prior to the release of the new app, the credit union reportedly gave $10 to each of its employees to buy bitcoin for educational purposes, both personally and for a training exercise in the application. NYDIG upped the ante by providing another $5 per employee. Transactions with bitcoin on the application will incur a 2% service fee and Achieva made it very clear that bitcoin deposits are not backed up or insured by the National Credit Union Administration. On the subject of regulation, Ingram stated: “From a compliance regulation standpoint, that’s always part of our focus, of really ensuring that we are working with those experts who know what’s coming.”",1
