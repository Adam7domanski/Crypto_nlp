Earning on indices and ETFs in the crypto world,"“Which DeFi project should you choose? Which coin to enter now? More than once this question has been circulating in your head. The answer to it is ""none."" However, this does not mean that you should stay out of the market. Contents In order not to waste your time, let's determine if this article is addressed to you? If you are a person already on the cryptocurrency market or just taking their first steps on it, then maybe yes. Perhaps yes, you will change for sure if you are not passionate about the crypto market and do not treat it as your main occupation. If you don't spend a few hours every day researching projects and the market, but want to profit from the upward cryptocurrency trends, this article is written just for you. If, on the other hand, you are a cryptocurrency bank, then ... maybe for you too. Because the crypto landscape is now so extensive that no one is able to comprehend it completely on their own. Because today we will tell you about how to earn (which also involves the risk of loss) on crypto trends, without the need to tediously select projects in which we want to invest. We have two very interesting instruments in traditional financial markets. Indices and ETFs. Their common feature is their basket structure. Let's start with the indexes. Probably everyone who has anything to do with financial markets has heard about such stock exchange indices as Dow Jones, SP500, DAX or our Polish WIG20. Such an index is a basket with selected values ​​to which their weight is assigned. The weight determines how much influence the value of the index has on the price of a given stock. For example, the WIG20 index is an index of the twenty largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Each of these twenty companies has a specific weight with which it affects the value of the index. Indices seem to be a great investment vehicle for people with the approach: I do not know, but they will earn (on a growing market or a trend). I don't have to choose individual stocks, I take the entire index. Which reflects the entire market (WIG), its specific segment (WIG20) or the industry (WIG.Games). There is only one problem - indices are not a financial instrument. They are a statistical tool that illustrates price changes in individual markets, segments and industries. We can track and observe the value of an index, but we cannot buy an index unit. And here, on traditional markets, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) come to our aid. Among them, I will say, we have the so-called index funds. They are a passive investment tool whose portfolio qualitatively and quantitatively reflects a given index. These are instruments that have been enjoying increasing popularity for years. Especially in foreign markets. And no wonder: it is simple and cheap to use, at the same time allowing you to catch the upward trend of a given market or trend. Until now, there has been little talk about indices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The community did not particularly feel the need to create them. Perhaps because, unlike traditional exchanges, where most companies are listed on one market, the most popular coins in crypto are listed on dozens or even hundreds of exchanges. And since most of the most highly valued coins on individual stock exchanges are the same, their indices would be characterized by a very high correlation. Hence the boom of such websites as coinmarketcap or coingecko, which aggregate statistical data on the entire cryptocurrency market. The situation started to change a bit this year, thanks to DeFi. First, we started to have a certain trend in the market that was not correlated with the entire market. Secondly, it is DeFi that is a place where new financial products can be created. So at the moment, these are the most common indices available on decentralized platforms, the vast majority of which try to reflect the trend of decentralized finance. Since these indices have a tokenized form (you can buy a token, i.e. a unit of the index), we can say that they are also ETFs. Two in one. Feel free to review decentralized crypto indices! The indexes I present are based on decentralized solutions. However, recently there are also indices created by centralized exchanges, the tokens of which we can buy on them. There was no place for them in this article, but we will mention them during. In all the cases discussed, these indices allow us to participate in the DeFi trend. We will probably have to wait for other solutions. I myself would like to see indexes with names like ORACLES, ETHKILLERS or POLKADOT. Most likely the first decentralized index on the market, allowing us to be exposed to the DeFi trend. Its first version appeared over a year ago, at the end of November 2019. In the middle of the hot DeFi summer, the composition of the index has changed. There are new coins and the possibility of dynamic management of the composition and weights of the index. At the time of writing this article, the composition of the sDeFi index was as follows: Capitalization: USD 3.9 million This index is an element. This means that it is not backed by actual project tokens in the index. And its value is based on the price information collected from the outside (using the CHAINLINK oracle). The advantage of this solution is the lack of price deviations of the index token even with its relatively low liquidity. This is due to the mechanism of operation of the Synthetix Network, in which each of the tokens uses the full liquidity of the protocol, and the price always comes from the oracle and the transactions that are not concluded do not change it. Learn more about the mechanics behind sDEFI and other synthetic Synthetix tokens in. The token can be purchased at. An interesting fact is that sDEFI also has its inverted twin brother iDEFI. It is a token whose price changes inversely to the price of the coins included in the index. It is therefore the perfect tool to short on the trend of decentralized finance. The PieDAO project offers several different products that we can call cryptocurrency indices or ETFs. Let's take a look at a few of them, bearing in mind that the community is constantly presenting proposals for new indexes that may appear on PieDAO in some time. PieDAO underneath uses a Balancer. So the indexes from this project contain the actual tokens of the projects included in the index underneath. Moreover, they represent a liquidity pool for decentralized applications, therefore they generate additional revenue from fees from token traders based on these pools. DeFi Large Capitalization Index. It contains proven projects, so it is a good solution for conservative investors who do not want to risk looking for new trend stars. They are interested in a more certain and stable profit from the further growth of the trend, which is why they bet on its current leaders. Index Composition: Capitalization: $ 2 Million. DeFi Small Capitalization Project Index. You could say that this is an index of potential DeFi emerging stars. On those who manage to shine, it will be possible to earn more than the market rate of return. However, we have the risk that not all projects will be able to do this. Index composition: Capitalization: $ 1.1 million Index focusing on the entire DeFi trend. It is an example of one of the great things about DeFi - compositional. This feature allows one existing product to be used as a component of another. The DEFI ++ index includes the two previously discussed indices with the following composition: Capitalization: USD 0.6 million. . And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Here we are exposed to the three fundamentally strongest trends in the crypto industry: Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. Capitalization: $ 1.4 million. And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Index designed by the creators of the DeFiPulse website. It can be said that this site is the CoinMarketCap counterpart for DeFi protocols. The index is based on the Tokensets technology and is available through this project. Index weights are systematically updated based on the capitalization of individual assets. Composition of the index: Capitalization: $ 23 million The index has a built-in fee of 0.95 percent of the index capitalization during the year. Finally, a very interesting ecosystem supported by a bigger idea. Not only creating token indices to have exposure to a given market. But also in order to use the management power of tokens in the index. Recall that most DeFi tokens are tokens that can be voted on in the protocols. Defining the directions of development or parameters of a given project. Few, however, use their tokens for these purposes. This is due, firstly, to a lack of awareness and, secondly, to the transaction fees associated with it. Collecting more of these tokens together in an index can be a factor in activating the management power of the tokens. Now let's move on to the two currently available indexes (more are on their way). An index that tries to reflect the strongest projects in the DeFi trend. Here is its composition Capitalization: $ 11.5 million Index for tokens related to. So, apart from YFI, we have on the list other projects co-created by Andre Cronje and projects with which Yearn Finance cooperates. Index Composition: Market Capitalization: $ 7.3M What would DeFi be without farming? Also, most of the solutions we have discussed allow you to derive additional profit from the index in the form of a protocol managing token, which is responsible for the creation of the index. Typically, this will be a reward for providing liquidity for the index in question. Annual rates of return on this account range from several dozen to several hundred percent per year (but remember which may eat some of the profits or even make us lose out on it). More time is dedicated to this aspect during our next one",0
"6 of crypto's loudest opponents that you should know about, from Dogecoin's co-creator to a star of 'The OC'","It's easy to find crypto disciplines singing the movement's praises online. There's Elon Musk, of course, alongside giant companies like Binance and Coinbase, and many other investors, developers, and apostles shouting its supposed social and financial benefits from the rooftops. But what about those opposed to cryptocurrencies? Let's take a look at the other side of the coin. The billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO has staunchly denounced crypto as merely a risky asset for a while, pushing back claims that it could revolutionize finance. He believes it's worthless because the virtual coin doesn't produce anything. Rather its value is only derived from someone else paying more for it (similar to the pyramid scheme comparison that some critics typically use.) ""If you and I buy various cryptocurrencies, they're not going to multiply,"" Buffet told CNBC in mid-2018. ""There are not going to be a bunch of rabbits sitting there in front of us. They're just gonna sit there. And I gotta hope next time you get more excited after I've bought it from you and then I'll get more excited and buy it from you."" Dimon has also not kept his distaste for crypto a secret, calling it a speculative asset class that is ""nothing like gold"" or traditional fiat currency. ""Something that's not supported by anything, I do not believe has much value,"" he said in mid-2021. He's made it a point to separate his opinion from his company though — JPMorgan allows users to make payments with a digital coin that the bank created, JPM Coin, and has given clients access to a number of crypto funds. One of the more surprising anti-crypto heralds is the co-creator of meme coin Doge himself. Jackson Palmer launched Dogecoin as a joke in 2013 and has since become a critic of cryptocurrencies, including posting a famous Twitter thread in 2021 declaring crypto ""an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology."" He said instead of crypto staying true to its decentralized roots, the space is now controlled by ""a powerful cartel of wealthy figures"" who have brought the worst parts of the centralized capitalist system into the market, like fraud and corruption. Cryptocurrency is built ""primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity,"" he said. Another eyebrow-raising addition to the anti-crypto clan is Ben McKenzie, who starred in the hit early aughts show ""The OC."" He made waves in 2021 for a Slate piece scolding celebrities for jumping into the space for profit while dismissing the effect their influence could have on unsuspecting investors who follow them online. Kim Kardashian, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and actor Matt Damon are just some big names that have partnered with crypto brands and projects. ""[It's not] a good idea for a public servant to promote gambling with one's entire paycheck in what is essentially an unlicensed, unregulated casino,"" the piece read. The Twitter account web3 is going just great has become a staple, tweeting hiccups big and small from the market to its 85,000 followers, from scammy investments to hacks that drain people's bank accounts. It's run by Molly White, a seasoned Wikipedia writer and editor who has been dubbed one of crypto's biggest alarm raisers. The gist of her stance is that crypto-loving figures and companies are marketing the space as an innovative technology and a way to get rich — only to bankrupt the everyday people that threw their financial support behind it. ""People are putting in money that they can't afford to lose,"" White told the Washington Post in May. ""They thought this might be their ticket out of poverty or they can finally stop working that minimum-wage job and then all their savings are gone."" The Democrat has long slammed the crypto market for operating without the same rules that exist within the traditional finance system — rules that help keep consumers safe from fraud and risk. She's also lambasted the wealth-consumed aspect of crypto culture and for most crypto holdings sitting in the uppermost echelons of society, which she says doesn't foster financial inclusion. ""We need real solutions to make the financial system work for everyone, not just the wealthy,"" she said in December. ""Bitcoin ownership is even more concentrated within the top 1% than dollars.""",1
Miner Incomes Under Stress,"With the market trading near the price lows of the 2021-22 cycle, a great majority of investors are now holding unrealized losses. Furthermore, miners appear to experiencing some income stress, with revenues falling, whilst production costs climb. Coming out of a bloody nine consecutive red weeks, the market closed its first weekly candle in the green, albeit with a relatively uninspiring weekly gain of 1.57%. The market traded between a weekly high of $31,900 and a low of $29,375. With prices trading at the lower end of the 2021-22 cycle range, the vast majority of buyers from the last 17-months are now holding unrealized losses. The intensity of this uncertainty and stress in the market is observable in on-chain data, with a continual reliance on Long-Term Holders to shoulder the load. We are also seeing miner revenues decline substantially, despite the climbing difficulty. This suggests that miner operations have expanded, capital has been spent, and production costs have increased as revenues are falling off. As profit multiples compress across the board and financial stress increases, the highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a Bitcoin bear market.",2
First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Defends $30K as ECB Preps First Rate Hike in More Than Decade,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.) Bitcoin ( BTC ) was holding steady Thursday as the European Central Bank announced its first interest-rate hike in more than a decade. As flagged in CoinDesk's Market Wrap newsletter on Wednesday, bitcoin's price this year has traded around expectations of central-bank monetary policy tightening – since the liquidity-sucking exercises also appear to influence cryptocurrencies. For most of this year, the U.S. Federal Reserve's actions have attracted most of the focus. Now that the ECB is also moving to rein in soaring inflation, crypto traders are paying attention. ""The globalization of markets means that this would affect all economies, so equities and crypto could suffer as a result in the short term,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at UK-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote Thursday in an email. After a 3% drop on Wednesday, the bitcoin price was flat to slightly higher on Thursday at around $30,200. For now, crypto bulls appear to have defended the crucial $30,000 price threshold . But some crypto analysts have warned that a deeper sell-off remains in the cards. ""We still believe that the bear market for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market has yet to play its final act, and that should be expected before the end of the year,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro. For the past four weeks, bitcoin has traded in a tight range from roughly $32,300 to $28,000. Such action resembles the U.S. stock market lately, where commentators have described the situation as "" boring ."" As more central banks follow the Fed's lead, markets might get more interesting again. Or maybe the central banks will simply suppress the volatility. ICYMI: Please check out a smart piece by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds in Thursday's First Mover Asia about major South Korean exchanges delisting litecoin ( LTC ). Wintermute concedes ""serious error"" leading to $15 million theft of Optimism's OP tokens Ethereum scaling solution Optimism announced Wednesday that $15 million in OP governance tokens have been stolen by attackers, Sam Kessler reports . Optimism intended to send the funds to a crypto-market maker, but they fell into the wrong hands when the market maker, Wintermute, provided Optimism’s team with an incorrect blockchain address. In a statement , Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy took responsibility for allowing the theft: “We made a serious error."" The attack followed a difficult couple of weeks for Optimism, whose botched OP token airdrop sent the token’s price tumbling in its first hours. The OP token fell an additional 20% on Wednesday's news, according to the most recent data from CoinMarketCap . Link to full story: $15M of Optimism Tokens Stolen by an Attacker After Wintermute Sent Wrong Wallet Address By Oliver Knight The Osmosis Chain will remain halted for at least 48 hours following a liquidity pool exploit that resulted in an estimated loss of $5 million. In a series of updates on Twitter (TWTR) and in a Discord post at 17:32 UTC on Wednesday, the Osmosis team said it will cover all losses using its strategic reserves. The bug was an issue with the JoinPoolNoSwap function, in which liquidity providers received 50% more than they should have when withdrawing from liquidity pools. The bug was exploited by a ""small number of individuals,"" Osmosis said. Four individuals have been identified as being responsible for 95% of the exploited amount. ""Funds have been linked to CEX accounts,"" Osmosis community analyst RoboMcGobo wrote on Discord , referring to centralized crypto exchanges . ""Law enforcement has been notified. We're hopeful that the exploiters will do the right thing here so that aggressive action will not be necessary.""

"Anchorage Spearheads Crypto Custody Exchange Network to Enhance Trading, Liquidity","Institutional crypto custody firm Anchorage along with other global crypto companies have formed a custody-exchange network in a bid to improve the crypto marketplaces for investors. The custody-exchange network seeks to promote a more fair market structure, no pre-funding needed, and safe participation via maintaining custody with Anchorage. When talking to exchanges, liquidity providers and custodians, the goal was to build a safer and segregated institutional custody vault, according to Diogo Monica, cofounder and president of Anchorage. There’s no conflict of interest between the institution that holds custody over one’s assets and the institution that executes the exchange, Monica told CoinDesk. “We actually genuinely believe it’s a better market structure going forward and answers a lot of the questions that regulators have had,” Monica said. Crypto exchange Binance.US is part of the new network, while Anchorage has commitments from CoinList, Blockchain.com , Strix Leviathan, and Wintermute, according to a statement. “As the American digital asset industry continues to mature, there is growing demand from institutions for custody, liquidity, and enhanced market access,” Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder said in the statement. “By combining the advanced security of Anchorage with the best-in-class exchange technology of Binance.US , this integration eliminates multiple pain points to institutional trading, and marks a major milestone in the evolution of digital asset infrastructure.” In March, Anchorage joined the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), a policy group for the fund management industry with over 2,000 members, including most of the world’s hedge funds.
