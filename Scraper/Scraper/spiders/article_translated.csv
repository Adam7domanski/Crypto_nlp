1049,Understand approve,"Today's article is for those who do not want to experience the mystery of tokens disappearing from their wallets for themselves. The rest may diverge. Contents Every time you perform operations on tokens under some smart contract on the Ethereum network or derivative. As derivative networks we consider those based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The most popular of them are BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrium, Gnosis Chain, Optimism or Cronos. So when you do something with DeFi tokens on these networks, before you do it, you must perform an approve transaction. Sometimes a given page may call it a little different, e.g. or. So that the smart contract can operate with the tokens you have. This is due to how Ethereum's smart contracts work. Each smart contract has its own address. Exactly the same as yours or my wallet. And we can send such a smart contract to this address, whether it is Ether or an ERC-20 token. Then the smart contract will not know what to do with these resources. They will just lie in it. However, they will in no way be productive for us. Moreover, in most cases they will no longer be pulled out. Therefore, we never simply transfer tokens to the address of the smart contract. Instead, we call its appropriate method. Of course, we don't do this directly. We use the interface prepared for us by the creators. We click on the website that prepares the appropriate transaction, asks us to sign it and sends it to be performed on the blockchain. Such methods are a set of instructions to be executed. For example, pay a token for a deposit. Often adopting parameters such as the address of the token or the amount of funds to be deposited. For example, we send a transaction to Compound to deposit 1000 DAI on a deposit. The problem is that although we know which token and in what quantity, we do not have these coins attached to the transaction itself. The smart contract has to get it for itself. But it cannot, because they are in our portfolio and only we can have them when signing transactions. And this is where the Approve deal comes in all in white. This transaction complies with the ERC-20 token standard. Let us remind you that each token is also really just a smart contract. Containing methods compliant with the aforementioned standard. One of them is Approve. They allow an external address to withdraw funds from our wallet without asking for permission (because we give it in advance when sending the Approve transaction). According to the ERC-20 specification, this transaction takes the following parameters (information from the user): Coming back to our example of a 1000 DAI deposit per deposit. Let's assume there are 2,000 DAI in our portfolio. When we go to the dAppki website with a deposit, the Approve option will appear. Depending on the website, it may be the Approve option for the amount you want to deposit (1000 DAI), or unlimited. Possibly both options to choose from. If we decide on a limited to 1000 DAI and then put this capital on a deposit, we will exhaust our permit limit. If you want to pay extra money later, you will have to make a new approve transaction first. If we give an approve with no limit, then we will be able to pay more capital immediately. Each stick has two ends. And the tails and the eagle coin. In the crypto world, the opposite poles of the spectrum are security and convenience (and cost). If we look only in terms of security, then each time we should approve only the amount of the transaction we want to make. Because by giving more rights, we allow the smart contract to take out the remaining balance of the given token from our wallet. Legitimate projects that have been audited and have open source code do not have the possibility of taking hostile and harmful actions for us. But there may be mistakes in them which will allow it to happen. Be in new inventions functionality will be implemented on purpose, allowing you to deprive us of our balance. On the other hand, we have convenience and cost issues (especially on Ethereum). Even in an ideal world of almost instant and almost free transactions, granting a limit of only a certain amount carries the inconvenience of a few more clicks on your next deposit. In practice, with expensive transactions and clogged networks, it involves additional costs (even a dozen or so dollars and more) and the waiting time for transaction confirmation (counted in minutes). So what is the common sense approach? I will share mine with you. I believe that proven, long-term projects are trustworthy. And I give them an approve with no limit. However, I approach new projects much more carefully. By allocating allowances only for a given amount. Although the Approve method is part of the ERC-20 standard, it can be implemented in a number of ways. Also in a way that is openly hostile to users. Attacks that implement hostile functionality in the Approve method of their token have been quite popular for some time. And in order for people to use this token, they give it to users through airdrops. Often directly on our wallets. By providing an underlying, apparent liquidity to the token to demonstrate its potential value. Imagine this situation. You see a new token on your wallet. You check what it is and what is its price on DEX. It turns out to be a few hundred dollars or more. WOW, free money from heaven. You want to cash it in as soon as possible. You approve on DEX to swap on the second transaction. Unfortunately, after the first transaction, the popular high-value tokens disappear from your wallet. How it's possible? What happened? After all, it was approve for a proven protocol (eg Uniswapa). However, the problem was with the approve implementation of this token itself. Where instructions were also thrown that allowed us to download other tokens from our wallet. Therefore, be very wise and careful with such gifts from heaven. It's best to do some research on it before you cash it in. It may be an idea to send the token to a separate wallet and only then continue playing with it. The problem is that the token can also have a hostile transfer method and we will hurt ourselves with it. A healthy habit is therefore not to touch tokens of unknown origin, with unknown effects and reputation. Often people think that the above-mentioned risks do not apply to them, because they use a hardware wallet. From Ledger or Trezor or something else. Nothing could be more wrong. After completing the approve on our part, the smart contract no longer needs any approvals and signatures on our part. The tokens are now available to him. We have already signed an approve transaction and no other transaction is needed. Regardless of which wallet we use. The granted entitlements to download tokens can be modified or withdrawn. This functionality is already offered by popular blockexplores of major networks, special services or some wallets. Some of the popular solutions are: Understanding how approve works is not the only critical aspect of safely using cryptocurrencies and DeFi.

1108,At-home bitcoin miners are getting crushed by the crypto sell-off and energy inflation. Here's how they're cutting costs.,"This brutal crypto winter has already claimed billion-dollar companies as victims — but it's also making life much tougher for fans who mine bitcoin from their spare room or garage. These hobbyists, who would typically use GPU rigs to pull in hundreds of dollars worth of cryptocurrency a month, have seen their profits plummet and their costs surge in a hellish 2022. Chris Vega and Michael Carter , who between them have two decades of experience mining bitcoin and advising others, told Insider how the US community is coping. ""It's easier for at-home miners to be innovative than large companies, because they have lower overheads,"" Carter said in a recent interview. ""Hobbyists are the ones that are innovating and trying new techniques to cut their costs."" Bitcoin has plunged more than 70% from its November all-time high, while prices for electricity — a big input cost for power-hungry mining — are soaring worldwide due to the energy crisis. Individual miners can't hope to control the price of bitcoin. But they can get creative to manage their utility bills. Some at-home US miners are relocating to take advantage of lower energy prices, according to Vega and Carter. Electricity costs are set to rise another 5% in the US this summer, according to government figures . But that masks a massive variation between states, with the US Chamber of Commerce forecasting a 16.4% rise in New England but only a 2.4% bump in the South-West. ""Lots of Americans are moving to a different state because electricity is cheaper there,"" Carter said. ""When there's a bear market , you tend to see a lot of migration by bitcoin miners."" Some crypto miners are even considering switching to renewable power sources to cut their electricity costs, the two said. Florida-based Vega said he'd heard of miners pivoting to solar power, while Carter said some in the Midwest were moving to states like Illinois or Missouri to take advantage of wind power there. ""There are a lot of incentives to use renewable energy here in the US,"" Carter said. ""If you're putting up large solar panels, you can get half of it paid off by the government, which can really help miners to cut their costs."" As well as providing free advice on YouTube, Carter — who runs a larger mining operation out of St Louis, Missouri — consults with larger Midwestern mining firms about how to optimize their setup. In the at-home mining world, though, some are selling old equipment to raise capital. On second-hand sites like eBay , would-be crypto miners can pick up rigs for as little as $300. Longtime hobbyists would likely find selling their equipment a painful prospect, Vega and Carter said, but those who first bought rigs in last year's run-up to market highs could be looking for a quick way out of crypto. ""Many people in the mining space don't want to sell their hardware,"" tech fanatic Vega told Insider. ""Sellers tend to be newcomers that entered the space when bitcoin was at its all-time high, and bought a lot of hardware at ridiculously high prices."" Vega started mining crypto as a teenager attending LAN parties. He told Insider his first foray involved him and his friends ""getting a bunch of laptops and piggybacking off grandma's Wi-Fi."" Both he and Carter are well positioned to see the community's suffering right now. But both expect hobbyists to survive the current crypto downturn if they can cut their costs. ""The mining scene is full of individuals who bring a unique flair to the industry,"" Vega said. ""I think — and hope — that the grassroot individual will continue to prevail.""

1026,Market Pulse: ETH 2.0 Stakers Are Underwater,"The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is one of the most anticipated, and most watched events in digital asset industry. However, with staked ETH locked up, and market prices declining over 75%, the vast majority of stakers are now firmly underwater on their position. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is one of the most anticipated, and most watched events in the digital asset industry. The transition from the current Ethereum consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake is a major technical and engineering feat. With the Beacon Chain operational since December 2022, many Ethereum investors have deposited their coins to operate a validator. Each validator requires a stake of 32 ETH and can be operated by either solo staking, via a staking pool (e.g. Lido, Rocket Pool), or via exchanges. To become a validator, investors must deposit their 32 ETH into the 2.0 contract, however, as yet there is no date at which these coins can be withdrawn. Nevertheless, the deposit contract has seen a consistent inflow of coins since going live in November 2020. The total ETH deposited has now reached 12.98M ETH, which is over 10.9% of the circulating supply. A total of 8.02M ETH (62%) was deposited before the Nov 2021 market ATH, and the remaining 38% was deposited after. At the November peak, the total USD value of staked ETH reached $39.7 Billion, representing 263,918 network validators. However after the ATH, the USD value in the 2.0 contract dropped by -$25.65 Billion. This is despite an additional inflow of nearly 5M ETH and puts the USD value of staked ETH 65.2% lower than at the ATH. With ETH prices plunging to levels below 2018 ATH, the has been a notable slow-down in 2.0 deposits. Throughout 2020 and 2021, it was common to see between 500 to 1,000 new deposits of 32 ETH per day. Currently, the weekly average number of deposits has dropped to just 122 per day, which is the lowest it has been to date. Aside from fear and uncertainty across the market, another reason may be the somewhat poor rate of profitability that has been experienced by ETH stakers to date. Since ETH cannot be withdrawn yet, we can calculate the value of ETH at the time it was deposited (called the Realized Price). We can see that ETH deposits were sent into the contract at an average price of $2390. With spot prices currently at $1,060, this means ETH 2.0 stakers are on average holding a loss of -55%. If we compare this to the Realized Price for the entire ETH supply, 2.0 stakers are currently shouldering 36.5% larger losses compared to the general Ethereum market. Lastly, we can see that almost all of the 2.0 deposits which are in profit today, were made as far back as Jan 2021, at a time when ETH was under $1,000. As of today, just 17% of the ETH deposited are in profit, with these deposits shown in blue below. With ETH 2.0 staking yield currently at around 4.2%, a decline in overall ETH token price of 55% below the cost basis of the average staker, this perhaps explains, in part, the overall slow-down in deposit activity. A key takeaway from this study, is the observation that investors who utilised liquid staking derivatives like Lido, or trade-able ETH 2.0 tokens on exchanges were likely better able to hedge downside price risk. This and highlights why the demand for these liquid staking derivatives has been so high, alongside the ability to use as collateral in DeFi applications.",https://insights.glassnode.com/market-pulse-eth-stakers-underwater/

Bitcoin ( BTC ): $20,824, -3.5% Ether ( ETH ): $1,165, -4.2% The week ahead: U.S. inflation report due; economists assess impact of Abe assassination Crypto markets weakened over the weekend, with bitcoin sliding for a third straight day and falling back toward $20,000 as of press time on Sunday. Some analysts are now pinning $17,000 as a key market support level. ""We continue to expect choppy price action,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, in an email. ""More strong bidding around the $17K level, if bitcoin falls there again, will be a strong signal for the bulls and may indicate the formation of a potential bottom around that price."" Traders this week will be watching for the latest U.S. consumer price index reading, expected Wednesday . The report could influence market expectations over the Federal Reserve's next move, at a meeting later this month; as of the last reading, inflation was at its fastest in four decades . One point of consideration: This past Friday's report on U.S. jobs growth in June has alleviated some concerns that the country is already in a recession; that should make it easier for the Federal Reserve to proceed with interest-rate increases of 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), or three times as fast as in past rate-hiking cycles. As CoinDesk's George Kaloudis wrote Sunday in his Crypto Long & Short column : ""A 75 basis point increase to interest rates in July is basically a foregone conclusion at this point."" And Oanda Senior Market Analyst Ed Moya wrote last week: ""If inflation delivers another upside surprise, the September meeting could see expectations fully priced in a half-point rate increase but that could easily go up to 75 basis-points."" Bank of Japan watchers are assessing what the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might imply for the nation's monetary policy, according to Bloomberg . Abe had been a strong advocate for ultra-easy financial conditions in the face of the country's economic stagnation. *Friday July, 8: S&P 500: 3,899 -0.8% DJIA: 31,338 -0.1% Nasdaq: 11,365 -0.1% Gold: $1,741 -1.3% Ashley Alder's Mixed Crypto Legacy in Hong Kong By Sam Reynolds The U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the nation's financial watchdog, announced Friday that Ashley Alder, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, will assume the post of chair in January 2023. While Adler has a long list of accomplishments regulating Hong Kong’s traditional finance securities market, his curriculum vitae isn’t as stellar when dealing with crypto. Certainly part of that is out of his control. As CoinDesk previously reported , the ""long shadow"" of China hangs over Hong Kong. China’s prohibition on crypto trading and Beijing’s fast erosion of Hong Kong's separate and autonomous legal system has chilled interest in the industry, and forced what interest there is into the narrow licensing regime that does exist. Hong Kong's recently passed licensing regime for exchanges , which is overseen by Adler's SFC, excludes non-accredited investors from trading on these exchanges (called Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, per local terminology). For as much criticism as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Gary Gensler gets, this is never something that the SEC has considered. Secondly, any exchange that serves Hong Kong, even if located abroad, would need to comply with these same licensing requirements. Treated as a Security Perhaps the bigger issue with the SFC’s treatment of crypto is the regulator treats it as a security. This is especially going against the grain when global regulatory trends have backed away from treating all crypto as securities and are only looking for specific instances instead. The SFC’s bill requires exchanges to hold a “Type 1” license, which is used for dealing in securities. Hex Trust’s Alessio Quaglini has complained before that requiring this sort of license is akin to forcing a square peg into a round hole because of the uniqueness of the digital assets industry. Hex has been awarded licenses in both Singapore and Dubai with the intent to open more offices abroad. So while Alder’s TradFi regime saw Hong Kong lauded as one of the world’s freest economies by libertarian-leaning think tanks, that same assessment can’t be made for the future of finance. FTX voted with its feet and left the city, and only one firm, OSL, has bothered to get the license. It’s not yet known who will replace Alder, but it’s unlikely to be someone who wants to take a balanced and fair approach to crypto. 2 p.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): Japan machine tool orders (YoY June) 3 p.m. HKT/SGT(7 a.m. UTC): China new loans (June) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover/"" on CoinDesk TV : Robust Gains in US June Jobs Report Defies Recession Fears, Fmr Japanese PM Shinzo Abe Assassinated The U.S. economy added 372,000 jobs in June, more than the expected 250,000 according to Dow Jones estimates.

1069,"Come Proposals Decentralized, Yellow-Generating Stablecoin","Aave has proposed the creation of a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, GHO, as it looks to improve on the features of its lending platform. The fully collateralized stablecoin will be native to the Aave ecosystem and available on the Ethereum network initially. It is expected to be offered on other Aave-supported blockchains based on future community votes. Still a proposal, the plan is for Aave to allow users to mint GHO tokens against their supplied collaterals. GHO would be backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies chosen at the users’ discretion, while borrowers would continue earning interest on their underlying collateral. This would work similarly to existing algorithmic stablecoins, which mint exactly $1 worth of tokens when users provide $1 worth of cryptocurrency. In GHO’s case, a user must supply collateral (at a specific collateral ratio) to be able to mint GHO. Correspondingly, when a user repays a borrow position (or is liquidated), the GHO protocol burns that user’s GHO, the proposal explained. All decisions relating to GHO will be in the hands of Aave governance. GHO is expected to generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO, the proposal said. Aave said the GHO stablecoin will rely on “facilitators” for the smooth functioning of GHO. A facilitator, such as another protocol, will have be able to trustlessly generate and burn GHO tokens. The facilitators would have to be approved by Aave governance. Facilitators, however, will have limits in place to ensure they don’t abuse their powers. “For each facilitator, governance will also have to approve something that we call a bucket. A bucket represents the upward limit of GHO a specific facilitator can generate,” the Aave proposal said. Borrow interest rates for GHO will be deterehd by the AaveDAO, with a stable rate that may be adapted depending on market conditions. This design retains the Aave protocol’s borrow interest rate model flexibility, and it will be possible in the future to implement any interest rate strategy the Aave community sees fit. Community voting for the creation of GHO is expected to begin soon. Sentiment among Aave users remained mostly positive as of Friday. However, there were concerns around Aave controlling the interest rates offered to users and the intent of arbitrageurs who would work to maintain GHO’s $1 peg.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/08/aave-proposes-decentralized-yield-generating-stablecoin-gho/
